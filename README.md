# Repitch

is a real-time, MIDI-polyphonic, pitch-shifting audio plugin. It uses a [Variable Delay Line](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/node115.html) and was made with [JUCE](http://www.juce.com).

To use it, add a sidechain input and play some MIDI notes â€” the input will be pitch-shifted by the interval between those notes and middle C.
