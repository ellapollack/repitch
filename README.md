Download **Repitch** as a [standalone application](https://github.com/maxwellpollack/repitch/releases/latest/download/Repitch.app.zip) (Mac only), or as an [Audio Unit](https://github.com/maxwellpollack/repitch/releases/latest/download/repitch.component.zip) (Mac) or [VST](https://github.com/maxwellpollack/repitch/releases/latest/download/repitch.vst3.zip) (Windows) audio plugin.

Then, run it and play some MIDI notes. *Audio input will be polyphonically pitch-shifted by the notes' distances from **middle C**.*

The only parameter is the **"frequency"** (sample rate / size) of the [variable delay line](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/node115.html) used in the pitch-shifting algorithm, which is tunable to both pitch and tempo values.
